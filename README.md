# Backend Development â€“ Our first repository
This is the first repository of Laura Reibenschuh, Michael Sommer and Pirmin Steiner. They are studying content strategy at FH JOANNEUM in Graz where they are also attending the course Backend Development. In the first assignment they learnt how to set up a Hugo site,  customize the theme and adding content.

## Assignment 2
This project contains the second task of the project. There the students are completing the following tasks:
1. Creating a Github account
2. Following this guide https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ to establish a new repository, which should contain at least a reasonable readme.md file
3. Checking in their original Hugo site (the veryfirst one with the default theme)
4. Creating a branch in which they add all the changes they made when including (and probably optimizing) the new theme they selected
5. Make this branch the new master branch
6. BONUS (to probably improve grade): Publish the site in the master branch as a Github site, using one of these recipies:
* https://buddy.works/actions/hugo/integrations/git-push
* https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
